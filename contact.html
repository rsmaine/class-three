	<p> I am interested in the authors assistant position at <b>Acme Company</b>, as advertised on LinkedIn. I am currently employed as legislative director for Assemblywoman, Chairperson of the NYS Assembly. I believe that the skills and experiences I have gained at this position make me an ideal candidate for the job of authors assistant. As legislative director, I have developed strong writing and editing skills. For example, one of my main duties is to prepare Assemblywoman<b> Nora Kiels</b> personal legislation, which deals with issues related to her position as Senior Member of the NYS Assembly Standing Committee.I am confident that my experience in the Legislature and my research and writing skills qualify me for consideration. If you would like, I can provide you with current samples of my work. I have also enclosed my resume. I look forward to meeting with you and discussing my qualifications in more detail.</P>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
	<p> Renee Sharmaine Escalada.</P>
